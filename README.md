# coderCoachOrganizer


### THE PROBLEM

When a computer club coach  is preparing a lesson plan, deciding on resources to use, choosing activities for club members - it is often difficult to organize the information, and keep the information organized during the club meetings. The coach would be well served by single place to put a YouTube playlist, notes that he/she can refer to, and even images to work with - that they can then show and/or use to help engage their class/club members. 

### SOLUTION APP DELIVERS

There are a multitude of websites such as [code.org](https://code.org) or [hourofcode.org](https://www.hourofcode.com), [The Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - but I would like to build an app that is a central place to save links to these sites and links to articles from Medium, Freecodecamp, Dev.to, or The New York Times. Find a way to log everything inputted to a particular date - meaning whenever an article is added to someone's article list - then that entry would be dated - much like a blog post.


### USER

My user would be people like myself who are interested in exposing people of all ages to programming principles and would like to create a free account to plan their activities - whether in a homeschool situation - or in an academic or volunteer position. People who are interested in using a tool where they can plan their curriculum, lessons or various notes on the subject. 

#### February 22nd and February 23rd

Worked on planning here. No coding. Just wireframes and getting the flow and content clear in my mind. Recieved some inspiration with the idea that I could use this app in my work if I were ever to teach basic coding and scripting to adults in Nicaragua. Worked on understanding all the pieces and figuring out how many different models I will need.

#### February 24th

Had our first standup today. Solidifying project concepts. Recieved a suggestion from Anna and Sarah to work with the Cloudinary API.

Met with a UX Designer today and that helped. Got some suggestions. I am changing to horizontal navigation instead of vertical for this app. Also, want to continue to clarify user flow.

#### February 25th

Got my models created last night. Setting up controllers and routes today. I want to start on building a few views out if possible and researching Cloudinary.

#### February 26th - Wednesday

I made some good progress today on building the controllers for functionality in the various views. Also, working with ejs templates. Will learn more about Cloudinary tonight. Good progress today. I feel good about leaving school today and working on it at home. Just keep working and do not give up.

#### February 27th - Thursday

Made good progress on functionality today with the ejs views and routes - still waiting until I get a bit further to implement Cloudinary. I might get into styling today. Currently my app looks like this:

### STRETCH GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT

Add more than one api. Possibly work with the YouTube API. Possibly work with the Github API in some way or New York Times API.

Make it so people can watch YouTube videos in browser.

Find a way that people can write in markdown - like on Github or stackoverflow - if they choose to. Code snippets. And all the rest of what markdown provides.
