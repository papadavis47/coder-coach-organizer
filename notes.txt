    Here is some code I will not use now, but will use later.

    router.get("/:id/notes", (req, res) => {
  res.render("topics/notes.ejs");
});

// This will display a particular topic and any links that are connected to it

router.get("/:id/links", (req, res) => {
  res.render("topics/links");
});

// This will display a particular topic and any images that are connected to it


router.get("/:id/images", (req, res) => {
  res.render("topics/images");
});
