#### From now until the end of day today:

Work on this sprint plan. Have a plan for each day. Anna suggested I work backwards from the finished product.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Sunday

I need to have a day on Sunday where I just work on testing and making the app look like I want it to look. I will break this down further later.

#### Saturday

I will not be able to work much on this day, except to maybe do two or three hours in the morning. But I can get some easy stuff done.

#### Friday

I need the main meat of the problem solved by the end of this day. I need to understand what I need to understand in order to finish, otherwise I do not think I can finish. So, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday are going to be very important.

#### Thursday

I want my app to be taking data from the database here and adding to it, and be working on the backend by the end of the day. I also want to implement Cloudinary by the end of the day.

#### Wednesday

Here is where I want to be working with my database by this day.
